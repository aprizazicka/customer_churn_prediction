# ðŸ“‰ Customer Churn Prediction

This project is a machine learning application that predicts whether a customer will churn (i.e., leave a service) based on their usage patterns and account details.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

The app uses a trained machine learning model (e.g., XGBoost or Random Forest) served through a Flask web application. The frontend allows users to input customer data through a form, and the backend predicts churn based on the model.

## ðŸ§  Model Features

The model was trained on the following features:

- `state`
- `account_length`
- `area_code`
- `international_plan`
- `voice_mail_plan`
- `number_vmail_messages`
- `total_day_minutes`
- `total_day_calls`
- `total_day_charge`
- `total_eve_minutes`
- `total_eve_calls`
- `total_eve_charge`
- `total_night_minutes`
- `total_night_calls`
- `total_night_charge`
- `total_intl_minutes`
- `total_intl_calls`
- `total_intl_charge`
- `number_customer_service_calls`
